                                <p><em>Resurgence</em> was a semester-long project I completed in my Advanced Game Design class. The objective of the assignment was to utilize novelty mechanics to create a fun and unique gameplay experience. Designed around the <a id="challenge" class="define">challenge</a> and <a id="fellowship" class="define">fellowship</a> game design aesthetics, <em>Resurgence</em> was the only cooperative game in the class, thereby creating a unique social experience.</p>

                        <h3>Process + Challenges</h3>
                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p>During early brainstorming stages, I was inspried by the design process of Nintendo's <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Everything about that game, concept, artistic theme, even the story, derives from the core gameplay mechanic of the player throwing their hat.</p>
                        <div class="sum-divide no-space">
                            <p>So, my teammates and I brainstormed interesting gameplay mechanics and let the concept materialize naturally as we refined our mechanics.</p>
                            <p>Our first step forward was the idea of allowing players to control the elements of their environment. Originally, we played with the concept of electricity: moving through circuits and activating mechanisms to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles.</p>
                            <p>This elemental concept got me thinking about how different elements interact with one another and how that combination could lead to a fun and social gaming environment. After further iteration and refinement, we landed on the idea of cooperative play between Water and Earth based characters.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="sum-remainder">
                            <img class="strict-img" src="img/core-loop.jpg" alt="Core Gameplay loop." />
                        </div>

                        <div class="sum-divide no-space">
                            <p>We started talking about what kinds of abilities our two characters should have. Eventually, I came up with our final 4 abilities for our two players. The Earth character has the transpose ability (throw rock platforms around a level) and the fissure ability (open and close gaps in the ground). Our water character had the dive ability (able to navigate through pipes to reach otherwise unattainable locations in a level) and the geyser ability (creating powerful spouts of water that push platforms, players and enemies).</p>
                            <p>My next task was to implement the water abilities using the Unity editor and my own C# scripts. Geyser proved to be a bit of a challenge as I utilized Unity components I was not familiar with like Buoyancy Effector2D but eventually I had my desired functionality.</p>

                            <p>Lastly was level design. My task was to create our most challenging level. I wanted to use all mechanics available to me while creating a bit of a difficulty spike for our players. This level was to act as a final challenge before our final boss. I looked at creating a faster paced level that would create some timing challenges for our players as well as forcing players to use their abilities in an offensive manner.</p>

                        <h3>Final Product</h3>
                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p>After hours of designing, iterating, playtesting and refining, we had quite a positive final result. Industry judges felt that we nailed the collaborative aspect of our game and that it was a joy to play with peers.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, for our final showcase, we had invited a group of high school students to play all of the games in the class. <em>Resurgence</em> earned the People's Favourite Award as voted by our guests.</p>
                        <p>Had this project continued, I would have liked to implement a few more dynamic camera effects, like a paralax scroll, to create a more cohesive game environment and I would have liked to further merge the narrative aspect of our game with the gameplay by adding lore collectibles and little cutscenes.</p>
