                        <div class="sum-divide">
                            <p>Unity UI contains a set of UI components that automatically organize UI elements in a screen. These components are called <em>Layout Groups</em>. Unity Layout Groups are broken down into 3 separate components: <a id="grid-layout-group" class="define">Grid Layout Groups</a>, <a id="horizontal-layout-group" class="define">Horizontal Layout Groups</a>, and <a id="vertical-layout-group" class="define">Vertical Layout Groups</a>. This system is widely used by developers as it is provided by default, intuitive, and automates an otherwise arduous <a id="dirtying" class="define">dirtying process</a>.</p>
                            <p>In terms of performance, this system is incredibly flawed. In fact, at a Unity developers conference, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wxitgdx-UI" target="_blank">Unite Europe 2017</a>, Unity advised developers to avoid using Layout Group components whenever possible. </p>
                            <p>The reason being, the dirtying process is significantly cumbersome on a CPU. To be brief, whenever some data on screen changes, Unity marks this element as <em>dirty</em>, and then for every frame, Unity redraws/recalculates all dirty elements. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Each time a Layout Group is dirtied, Unity's <em>Layout Rebuilder</em> uses a function called <em>GetComponents()</em> to find the dirty component's <em>Root Layout Group</em>. This function is infamous for being expensive in terms of performance, and when you have multiple nested and dynamic Layout Groups, this cost grows multiplicatively.</p>
                        <p>My task was to create a custom and performant Layout Group system that could be used as an alternative for all Layout Groups in a live product with millions of users.</p>

                        <h3>Process + Challenges</h3>
                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p>Since this was a live product and the end-goal was to replace every Unity Layout Group, I had to be extremely careful to ensure the custom Layout Groups would not break any UI elements. With this in mind, I identified my high-level requirements for the structure and functionality of the system:</p>
                        <p>1. My system should live on top of Unity's as a separate entity. This would allow me to inherit the organizing functionality of each Layout Group without overwriting the original system.</p>
                        <p>2. Change the original <em>Layout Group</em> and <em>Layout Rebuilder</em> systems as little as possible. In case of emergency, we could revert back to Unity Layout Groups if needed.</p>
                        
                        <div class="sum-divide no-space">
                        <p>My next task was to breakdown how Unity's Layout Groups and Layout Rebuilder interact with each other. After reading through Unity's documentation and some C# files, I was able to breakdown the flow of a layout rebuild and map out the relationship between these systems using a <a id="class-diagram" class="define">class diagram</a> (a diagram that describes the structure of a system using the system's classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships among objects).</p>
                        <p>For each <em>SetDirty()</em> call inside of <em>LayoutGroup.cs</em>, <em>LayoutRebuilder.MarkLayoutForRebuild()</em> is called. This function walks up the Layout Group object hierarchy using <em>GetComponents()</em> to find the <em>RootLayout</em>. The <em>RootLayout</em> is validated if needed using more <em>GetComponents()</em> calls. If valid, a <em>LayoutRebuilder</em> object is instantiated and stores reference to the <em>LayoutRoot</em>. The <em>CanvasUpdateRegistry</em> class registers root and orchestrates the layout update. Lastly once the rebuild completes, the <em>Rebuilder</em> instance is released from the pool of to-be-rebuilt Rebuilders.</p>

                            <p>Next was gameplay design. <em>Dragon Up</em> has both idle and active gameplay mechanics. Primarily, players spend coins to upgrade dragons and their nests which, in turn, generate larger sums of coins. When enough coins are reached, the player can automate coin production for each dragon nest. When the player reaches their coin amount goal, they enter the active part of the game: <em>Feeding Time</em>. Here players must tap the screen as fast as possible to feed their dragons and earn item bonuses. When this portion of the game is complete, the game resets and the player must start the automation process again.</p>
                            <p>I struggled for a bit with ideating new gameplay ideas. I couldn't quite think of an interesting way to revamp both idle and active game mechanics that fit my theme, but also connected to each other.</p>
                            <p>Once again, I started brainstorming using another affinity diagram. Not only did I need a fresh way to present these mechanics, but they also needed to fit my theme and narrative. My final concept derived the feeding time mechanic. Instead of completing a certain number of objectives and feeding dragons, I reframed the mechanic to involve tapping the screen to fight off the nightmare monsters that were growing in strength during the Halloween season. Furthermore, <em>Dragon Up</em> had a mechanic where 2 legendary dragons can multiply coin output and 1 legendary dragon would multiply coin production rates. I decided to change that so that now one of those dragons would multiply attack power, allowing the player to fend off more monsters. This would also open another revenue stream as the event could offer new items and boosts for purchase around this new mechanic.</p>
                            <p>I had several game mechanic ideas that you can see for yourself in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-NRIp34LccpJmH48kRxOggk5zMRj6HHHuPR_4yY-eU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">design document</a>!</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>My last tasks were ideating new event-specific rewards and creating a new asset list. As with my previous work, I wanted my new rewards and assets to fit my unique theme and play into my story and characters. Upon completing my brainstorming, I finalized a list of assets and milestone rewards that players would earn by progressing through the event. Rewards included items like gems (for general shop use), potions (for upgrading dragons) and dragon cards to unlock the dragon I created for this event named <em>Hypnorman</em>.</p>
                        <p>You can see all my reward ideas and asset list in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-NRIp34LccpJmH48kRxOggk5zMRj6HHHuPR_4yY-eU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">design document</a>!</p>

                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p>My <em>Dragon Up</em> design earned second place in the game design competition. I was very happy with my final product. My theme was captivating and used the Halloween season effectively to persuade players to spend some money for the event. The gameplay was reframed in a fresh way that wouldn't require very much time or money to implement in-game, and it fit my narrative very well. Furthermore, there was only a small amount of rewards required for new reward and character assets.</p>
                        <p>Had this project allowed more time and a larger scope, I would have enjoyed working with other designers to further flesh out ideas and to sketch some designs of my own for my new characters and rewards.</p>
