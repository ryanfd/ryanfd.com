                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p><em>Dragon Up: Idle Adventure</em> is a free-to-play mobile game and I had the opportunity to design a high-level concept for a 24-hour long event. The objective of the competition was to design a unique theme and narrative that player's would excited players and entice them to complete the event. Furthermore, I needed to crete a new way to use the pre-existing mechanics of Dragon Up in a fresh new way that connected to my theme and narrative.</p>
                        <p>Check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-NRIp34LccpJmH48kRxOggk5zMRj6HHHuPR_4yY-eU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">design document</a> for a thorough break down of my creative process!</p>

                    <div class="section expand">
                        <h3>Process + Challenges</h3>
                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p>I love to brainstorm using affinity diagrams. It is a simple method for ideation, but I find it very effective. I often set myself a 2 - 5 minute timer (dependent on the size of the project) and write down any and every idea that comes to me on a pad of sticky notes, one idea per note. It doesn't matter how good of an idea it is, I think of it, write it down and forget about it.</p>
                        <div class="sum-divide no-space">
                            <p>I started with developing my narrative and theme. I wrote down ideas for narrative arcs, new characters (allies and enemies), lessons to teach, etc. After 2 minutes, I had written down 25 ideas that I could further develop if they jumped out at me.</p>
                            <p>From there, I bundled my ideas together into categories that I noticed were standing out (Story, Lesson/Theme, Dragons, Allies, Enemies, and Seasonal/Holiday Theme). Once I had my ideas separated by category, I could start grouping ideas from different sections together. At the end of this stage, I ended up with 3 rough ideas for a narrative and theme that included ideas for narrative arc, characters, and calls to action.</p>
                            <p>For a little bit, I struggled with one aspect of my ideation. <em>How would I make this event financially successful?</em> While I liked my preliminary ideas, I was having a hard time thinking of how my theme would entice players to spend some money on the event. At the time, Halloween had just passed. I started thinking about consumer habits during holidays and also researched spending habits of the general public during Halloween. In my research I found that Halloween spending had grow an extra $2 billion from the year prior. That's when I figured out my theme and narrative: a Halloween event about the monsters of the Dragon Up world growing stronger, and the player having to oppose them.</p>
                            <p>Take a look at my affinity diagrams, their organization, and my final narrative concept in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-NRIp34LccpJmH48kRxOggk5zMRj6HHHuPR_4yY-eU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">design document</a>!</p>

                            <p>We started talking about what kinds of abilities our two characters should have. Eventually, I came up with our final 4 abilities for our two players. The Earth character has the transpose ability (throw rock platforms around a level) and the fissure ability (open and close gaps in the ground). Our water character had the dive ability (able to navigate through pipes to reach otherwise unattainable locations in a level) and the geyser ability (creating powerful spouts of water that push platforms, players and enemies).</p>
                            <p>My next task was to implement the water abilities using the Unity editor and my own C# scripts. Geyser proved to be a bit of a challenge as I utilized Unity components I was not familiar with like Buoyancy Effector2D but eventually I had my desired functionality.</p>

                            <p>Lastly was level design. My task was to create our most challenging level. I wanted to use all mechanics available to me while creating a bit of a difficulty spike for our players. This level was to act as a final challenge before our final boss. I looked at creating a faster paced level that would create some timing challenges for our players as well as forcing players to use their abilities in an offensive manner.</p>

                        <hr class="sub">
                        <p>After hours of designing, iterating, playtesting and refining, we had quite a positive final result. Industry judges felt that we nailed the collaborative aspect of our game and that it was a joy to play with peers.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, for our final showcase, we had invited a group of high school students to play all of the games in the class. <em>Resurgence</em> earned the People's Favourite Award as voted by our guests.</p>
                        <p>Had this project continued, I would have liked to implement a few more dynamic camera effects, like a paralax scroll, to create a more cohesive game environment and I would have liked to further merge the narrative aspect of our game with the gameplay by adding lore collectibles and little cutscenes.</p>
